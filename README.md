False Nine App. Team Project for Software Engineering for Business Applications course at TUM.

## Setup

To run the project on a development environment, download repo and browse to the root directory where you have the repo from the terminal.

Run, `npm install`. This should install all the dependencies. If you don't have node, or npm, please download it from [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node). Please make sure that you have npm version 5 or larger.

After this, run `npm build:dev`, and from another terminal tab, run `npm start`. If no errors thrown, you should be able to go `localhost:3000` from the browser and see hello world initial application. If errors are thrown, please try to figure out where the error might be depending on your machine.
